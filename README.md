## it is modified in the vscode in windows and change both the name and email, the name is Ygf and the email is 18145646512@163.com but still commited through gi bash instead of in vscode.

## let's try to do the "add" "commit" "push" in vscode!
> *You can see an system control icon on the left of vscode, click it. You can see the change you've made in the repository. But it's only can be seen after modified and saved. So don't forget to save the file. "Stage changes" is equal to "add". "Commit" is just the same as "commit". If not staged, by clicking directly the "Commit", it can not be commit and push. It turns out to be YGf.
