# Use Git in Vscode
## let's try to do the "add" "commit" "push" in vscode!
> *You can see an system control icon on the left of vscode, click it. You can see the change you've made in the repository. But it's only can be seen after modified and saved. So don't forget to save the file. "Stage changes" is equal to "add". "Commit" is just the same as "commit". If not staged, by clicking directly the "Commit", it can not be commit and push. It turns out to be YGf.Also the push process can be done by the botton icon. You can see clearly whether there are some changes to push or pull. Only after commit.*

## try to modify in the website and then use pull in the vscode.
> *You need to click the refresh icon so the botton icon can show there is a pull. Then it works all well.*

## what if modify the existed code instead of add code?
> *it becomes just the same as the one modified in website.*
